1. Learn methods for problem decomposition and program design. This consists of analyzing problem requirements, breaking the problem down, and designing an algorithm for each part of the problem.

2. Learn the C++ programming language syntax and features. Learn how to use C++ to solve "real-world" problems.

3. Learn basics of writing good code, proper software engineering techniques, and style, such that the code can be easily read and modified by other programmers, as well as yourself.

4. Learn some basic data structures used in programming, such as linked lists, both in the C++ Standard Library and implemented.

5. Learn practical programming concepts, that can be used to solve real problems in different disciplines.

6. Obtain introductions to other useful topics such as programming in a scripting language, etc., as time permits
