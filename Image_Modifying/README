Working with, and modifying pictures on a computer is big business. Images might be modified by performing image sharpening algorithms in order to better make out a criminal's face from a fuzzy surveillance camera photo. A company might charge a small fee for removing the "red eye" problem that flash photography suffers from, so that you can make better prints from your photos. Team members located in different cities might "mark up" an image during teleconferences in order to share their thoughts on images or graphs. And sometimes, you just want to be able to put conversation bubbles on a photo to add some humor. Each of these situations requires knowledge of how computers deal with imagery. This project will introduce you to a straight forward image format, and allow you to modify an image in a few specific ways.
