For this project, you will start by updating some of the data structures you implemented in project 4. Once the data structures we need are ready, you will implement a small event-driven simulation of a fast food restaurant. The simulation will allow us to play “what if” games to see how a change we might make could affect overall statistics for our restaurant business.


The specifications for the simulation are very vague, and that is done on purpose. The idea for this project is for you to come up with a solution entirely your own, including the planning, design, implementation, and testing. Despite the vagueness, it is critical that you pay close attention to the specific things that are required. We will be enforcing those requirements, and if your implementation is not designed the way the requirements call for, your program will be considered to be incorrect.

The detail of this project can be found in p5_specs_f18.pdf.
